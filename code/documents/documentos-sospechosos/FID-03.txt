How to measure similarity between two sequences is a key question in information theory and in computer science. Based on Kolmogorov complexity, we have proposed a metric to answer this question and prove it to be universal. A substantial tool is the documents similarity metric applied in fields such as plagiarism detection, problems necessary to capture the semantic, in relation to documents, determining the topic, or structural, or syntactic likeness of texts. To evaluate the proposed method, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising documents from diverse domains, including academic research papers, news articles, and online forums. We simulate various plagiarism scenarios, such as paraphrasing, sentence reordering, and word substitution, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our approach. Of different linguistic patterns in plagiarism committing, the taxonomy deep understanding supports, an example is example, texts changing into semantically equivalent but with different organization, texts shortening with concept specification and generalization, and ideas adopting, and of others, key contributions.
