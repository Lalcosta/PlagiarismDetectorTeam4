This systematic review provides unique findings with an updated examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using the PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a complete examination. Using a priori and reasoned coding, data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed and coded. The results of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications increased by almost two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid increase in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The results show that the research was carried out in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend shifted from the US to China, leading the number of publications. Another new trend is in the affiliation of researchers, as previous studies have shown a lack of researchers from education departments. This has now changed to be the more dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to findings from other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In the survey of who the AIEd was intended for, 72% of the studies were aimed at students, 17% at instructors, and 11% at managers. To answer the overarching question of how AIEd was used in ES, reasoned coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Assessment, (2) Prediction, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Student Learning Management. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to serve as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools such as Chat GPT.
