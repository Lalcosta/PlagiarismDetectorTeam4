Background: Despite the increased risk of developing secondary cancers in cancer survivors, there is limited knowledge regarding the current state of second cancer screening practices and associated factors among cervical cancer survivors.

Methods: Our study involved the enrollment of 809 cervical cancer survivors, all aged 40 years or older, who had received treatment at six hospitals between 1983 and 2004. Each participant completed a questionnaire that covered various aspects, including second cancer screening practices (specifically for breast, stomach, and colorectal cancers), as well as sociodemographic variables.

Results: Among the subjects, 38.9% reported having received recommendations for screening other cancers from their healthcare providers, while 27.4% believed they had a lower risk of developing other cancers compared to the general population. Notably, older individuals (65 years and above) and those with lower socioeconomic status (family income less than $1,000 per month) were less likely to undergo second cancer screening. The likelihood of undergoing breast cancer screening was higher among those who had received recommendations for other cancer screening from healthcare providers (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.54-2.98) and those who possessed an accurate perception of their risk for developing second cancers (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11-2.43).

Conclusion: The absence of healthcare provider recommendations for second cancer screening and the misperception of second cancer risk may have detrimental effects on the adherence to breast cancer screening among cervical cancer survivors.
