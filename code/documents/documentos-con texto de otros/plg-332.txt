There are many security applications like intrusion detection, malware detection, vulnerability scanning, etc. Existing methods are based on approximate matching algorithms that are obvious, slow, sometimes imprecise and difficult to adapt to new data. To overcome these problems, in this paper, a new method of embedding neural network based computers, viz. Vector numbers are generated using control images for each pair of features, and the indices can be used to optimize areas. .... between inserts in two locations. (1) A comprehensive study of cross-language search systems is presented, showing differences in obtaining monolingual transcripts, (2) two main solutions are considered, (3) evaluation. The stability of the cross section is verified and (4) the three models CL-CNG, CL-ESA and CL-ASA are compared. In this article, we focus on examining how people perceive different types of writing. This analysis helps to better understand the performance of the system and to test the quality / performance of the system. Unlike most tasks in this field that use objects (such as submitting authors, detecting violence, etc.), we focus only on tests, such as neutrality and documentation. So we did two experimental studies to see if people could identify which characters in text were the most similar. The first is a large population survey and the second is a qualitative study conducted by the authors of this article.
