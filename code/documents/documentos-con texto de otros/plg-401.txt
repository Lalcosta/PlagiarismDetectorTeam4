Cheating in computer science classes can damage the reputation of institutions and their students. It is therefore essential to routinely authenticate student submissions with available software plagiarism detection algorithms such as Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS). MOSS is a resource-intensive algorithm that identifies the similarities between two codes and generates a score for the pieces of code they share. This paper focuses on the operation of the MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) tool to identify potential cases of code plagiarism.
