The RAE defines plagiarism as "the act of essentially copying someone else's work and making it one's own". It is basically copying the idea. With the growth of information on the Internet, it has become increasingly easy to plagiarise any work, especially written work. For this reason, reliable tools are needed to detect plagiarism in text. There are two types of text plagiarism detection. Identifying internal and external plagiarism. Internal plagiarism detection is finding passages of text for a given document that may have been taken from some source that knows nothing more than the text itself. External plagiarism detection uses a pair of documents, an original and a suspect document, to determine whether the suspect document is plagiarised from the original. From now on, when discussing the plagiarism detection task, only the external plagiarism detection task will be referred to.
There are different classifications of which parts of a text (or spoken language) can be plagiarised.
* On the idea: This type of plagiarism is not based on words. A accepts the ideas, thoughts or theories of others without giving them equal weight. This type of plagiarism occurs when the original idea is not made public.
 * Word for word This is a copy of (an important part of) a sentence. And you can make an exact copy and even make some modifications. If there is no link to the source, it is plagiarism. In addition to literal plagiarism, there is interpretive plagiarism in which both wording and syntax are altered. This approach of interpreting as a form of plagiarism is not entirely correct.
* From sources: By including bibliographical references that another author has included in his own work d. However, A does not claim that these references are taken from d. Sometimes, A includes links without even reading them. 
*Authoritative means that the author of all the material is actually written by someone else. It is not uncommon for students to present other people's reports as their own.
