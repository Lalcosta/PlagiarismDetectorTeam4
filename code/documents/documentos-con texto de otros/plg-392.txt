Our results suggest that the mean similarity index among postgraduate theses in Austria is 8.78 (Standard deviation 4.91), while the mean similarity index among graduate theses prepared in Turkey is 25.10 ( Standard deviation 9.85). In fact, our analysis indicates that 91% (n 113) of theses prepared at Austrian universities and only 13% (n 17) of theses prepared at Turkish universities failed the acceptable similarity rate of 15%. The fact that 87% of the theses written in Turkey are dramatically similar to the available resources shows that many of the studies carry potential risks in terms of originality and plagiarism.
In this article, we discuss the architecture of the APAS web application with a focus on scalability issues. We review foundational features like dynamic analysis and unreliable code execution, as well as more complex cases like static analysis and plagiarism detection, and summarize the lessons learned from the previous six years of research. We identify scalability challenges, show how they have been addressed in APAS Edgar, and then propose general architectural solutions, building blocks, and patterns to address those challenges.
