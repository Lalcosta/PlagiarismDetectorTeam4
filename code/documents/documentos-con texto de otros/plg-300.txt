Plagiarism can take various forms, such as copying content or adopting ideas without acknowledging the original source. This paper introduces a new classification of plagiarism that emphasizes the distinctions between literal plagiarism and intelligent plagiarism from the perspective of the plagiarist's behavior. The classification provides a comprehensive understanding of diverse linguistic patterns employed in committing plagiarism. These patterns include altering texts to have the same meaning but with different words and structure, condensing texts through concept generalization and specification, and appropriating ideas and significant contributions from others. The paper discusses different textual characteristics associated with various types of plagiarism. It also surveys and relates systematic frameworks and methods used in monolingual, extrinsic, intrinsic, and cross-lingual plagiarism detection to the identified plagiarism types in the classification. The authors extensively examine state-of-the-art techniques for plagiarism detection, encompassing approaches based on character n-grams (CNG), vectors (VEC), syntax (SYN), semantics (SEM), fuzziness (FUZZY), structure (STRUC), writing style (STYLE), and cross-lingual methods (CROSS). Their investigation confirms that current plagiarism detection systems primarily focus on identifying textual copying and often fail to detect instances of intelligent plagiarism where ideas are expressed using different wording.
