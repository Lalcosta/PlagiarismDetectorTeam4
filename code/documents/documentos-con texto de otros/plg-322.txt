This project focuses on the development of a web application that automatically qualifies the solution to engineering exercises. The input data for each exercise is different for each student in order to reduce plagiarism and increase motivation. Students can access the web application from any device with Internet access (computer, laptop, phone,...) at any time. This paper describes the use of artificial intelligence chatbots in scientific papers. ChatGPT is a type of chatbot developed by OpenAI that uses a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model to understand and respond to natural language input. AI chatbots and ChatGPT appear to be useful tools, especially in scientific writing, helping researchers and scientists organize material, write first drafts, and proofread. No publications have been produced using this approach in the field of critical care medicine. However, this will be possible in the future.
