The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a technology capable of connecting heterogeneous nodes/objects, such as people, devices, infrastructure, and makes our daily lives simpler, safer, and fruitful. Generating large amounts of data that can be analyzed to help people make more informed decisions, providing an impact on the convenience of our lives and offering more opportunities to generate unique solutions.Being part of a large network of heterogeneous devices, these nodes are typically resource-constrained and became the weakest link to the cyber attacker. Classical encryption techniques have been employed to ensure the data security of the IoT network. However, high-level encryption techniques cannot be employed in IoT devices due to the limitation of resources. In this paper, we view the privacy issues related to data mining from a wider perspective and investigate various approaches that can help to protect sensitive information. In particular, we identify four different types of users involved in data mining applications, namely, data provider, data collector, data miner, and decision maker. For each type of user, we discuss his privacy concerns and the methods that can be adopted to protect sensitive information. We briefly introduce the basics of related research topics, review state-of-the-art approaches, and present some preliminary thoughts on future research directions. Besides exploring the privacy-preserving approaches for each type of user, we also review the game theoretical approaches, which are proposed for analyzing the interactions among different users in a data mining scenario, each of whom has his own valuation on the sensitive information. By differentiating the responsibilities of different users with respect to security of sensitive information, we would like to provide some useful insights into the study of PPDM.
