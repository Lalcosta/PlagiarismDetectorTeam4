When automatic plagiarism detection is carried out considering a reference corpus, a suspicious text is compared to a set of original documents in order to relate the plagiarised text fragments to their potential source. One of the biggest difficulties in this task is to locate plagiarised fragments that have been modified (by rewording, insertion or deletion, for example) from the source text. However, plagiarism detection is important for authors because of their investigations, researches, articles, among other things.  This paper presents a study of an n-gram-based document comparison method. The method is intended to build a large-scale plagiarism detection system. The work focuses not only on an efficiency of the text similarity extraction but also on the execution performance of the implemented algorithms. We took notice of detection performance, storage requirements and execution time of the proposed approach. The obtained results show the trade-offs between detection quality and computational requirements.
