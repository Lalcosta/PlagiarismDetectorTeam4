Lecturers encounter plagiarism quite often, so we try to prevent and detect plagiarism, but the size of the group makes it more difficult. Since cheating students often try to cover up (hide) their plagiarism, several equality check switches (commonly known as plagiarism detection tools) have been created to help educators. Focusing only on plagiarism detection, this paper is a comprehensive systematic review of the field of source code plagiarism detection in academia. This overview provides an overview of plagiarism settings, plagiarism detection tools, comparison statistics, disambiguation methods, datasets and algorithm types used for comparison. A personal view on the importance of source code plagiarism detection in academia, categorizing the available detection tools and analyzing their effectiveness. While writing the review, I found some interesting ideas about metrics and datasets for comparing quantitative detection tools and algorithms. Furthermore, the existing taxonomy of obfuscation methods is translated into a new definition: "Education for detection of source code plagiarism".
