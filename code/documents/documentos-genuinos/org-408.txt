Plagiarism Detection Using Semantic Technology 
Plagiarism of digital documents seems a serious problem in today's era. Plagiarism refers to the use of someone's data, language and writing without proper acknowledgment of the original source. Plagiarism of another author's original work is one of the biggest problems in publishing, science, and education. Plagiarism can be of different types. This paper presents a different approach for measuring semantic similarity between words and their meanings. Existing systems are based on the traditional approach. For detecting plagiarism, traditional methods focus on text matching according to keywords but fail to detect intelligent plagiarism using semantic web. We have suggested new strategies for detecting the plagiarism in the user document using the semantic web. In paper we have proposed architecture and algorithms to better detection of copy case using semantic search, it can improve the performance of copy case detection system. It analyzes the user document. After the implementation of this technique, the accuracy of plagiarism detection system will surely increase.
