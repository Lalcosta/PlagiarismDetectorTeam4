Generally, the process of plagiarism detection can be divided into two main stages: source retrieval and text alignment. The paper evaluates and compares effectiveness of five fingerprint selection algorithms used during the source retrieval stage: Every p-th, 0 mod p, Winnowing, Frequency-biased Winnowing (FBW) and Modified FBW (MFBW). The algorithms are evaluated on a dataset containing plagiarism cases in Bachelor and Master Theses written in English in the field of computer science. The best performance is reached by 0 mod p, Winnowing and MFBW. For these algorithms, reduction of fingerprint size from 100 % to about 20 % kept the effectiveness at approximately the same level. Moreover, MFBW sends overall fewer document pairs to the text alignment stage, thus also reducing the computational cost of the process.
