Plagiarism, or unauthorised reuse without linking text, is a phenomenon of great concern due to the wide variety of bibliographic and information resources available on the Internet. Due to the size of the problem, it is almost impossible to manually check for plagiarism. The so-called automatic plagiarism detector was created as a preventive and corrective measure to help people detect plagiarism in text, which is the job of forensic linguistics. It should be noted that automated plagiarism detection tools are only intended to help people detect plagiarism by providing them with the best possible evidence of a possible case of plagiarism. The final decision as well as the appropriate action should be taken by an expert.
