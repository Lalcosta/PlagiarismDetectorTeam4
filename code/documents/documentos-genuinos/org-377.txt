The RAE defines plagiarism as "the act of essentially copying someone else's work and making it one's own". It is basically copying the idea. With the growth of information on the Internet, it has become increasingly easy to plagiarise any work, especially written work. For this reason, reliable tools are needed to detect plagiarism in text. There are two types of text plagiarism detection. Identifying internal and external plagiarism. Internal plagiarism detection is finding passages of text for a given document that may have been taken from some source that knows nothing more than the text itself. External plagiarism detection uses a pair of documents, an original and a suspect document, to determine whether the suspect document is plagiarised from the original. From now on, when discussing the plagiarism detection task, only the external plagiarism detection task will be referred to.
