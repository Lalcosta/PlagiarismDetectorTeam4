Supervised learning is a method for inferring functions from training data. The training data consists of pairs of objects (usually represented by vectors); one component of this pair is the data describing each object, and the other is the class to which the object belongs. The output of the function can be either a numeric value or a label. The goal of supervised learning is to produce a function that is able to predict the value corresponding to any valid input object after looking at a set of examples, i.e. training data. To do this, it needs to generalise the data presented to situations that have never been seen before.
