Today, plagiarism, piracy and moral condemnation is a serious problem worldwide. It is necessary to understand the concept of plagiarism, the different types of plagiarism that exist and then to analyse its impact at the academic and professional level. Several cases of plagiarism at global and national level show the seriousness of the problem and its prevalence. Despite copyright laws, plagiarism is not exactly criminalised in all countries, which means that many of these acts often go unpunished. There is a need for better education on plagiarism to prevent future plagiarism.
