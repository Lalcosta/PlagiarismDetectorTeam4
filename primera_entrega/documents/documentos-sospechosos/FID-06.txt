The short text matching task uses an NLP model to predict the semantic relevance of two texts. It has been used in many fields such as information retrieval, question answering and dialogue systems. This paper will review several state-of-the-art neural network based text matching algorithms in recent years. We aim to provide a quick start guide to beginners on short text matching. The representation based model DSSM is first introduced, which uses a neural network model to represent texts as feature vectors, and the cosine similarity between vectors is regarded as the matching score of texts. Word interaction based models such as DRMM, MatchPyramid and BERT are then introduced, which extract semantic matching features from the similarities of word pairs in two texts to capture more detailed interaction information between texts. We analyze the applicable scenes of each algorithm based on the effectiveness and time complexity, which will help beginners to choose appropriate models for their short text matching applications.
