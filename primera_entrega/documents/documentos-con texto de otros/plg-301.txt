The purpose of this work is to analyze the state of the art in the analysis of source code focusing on plagiarism detection and obtain a proposal for future work in this area. Detection of plagiarism is the combination of detecting clones and similarities within various texts. Nowadays, there are several approaches that can be divided into three levels. The first one is a text based method and uses plain text as an input. The second one is based on tokens. And the third level uses models to represent the source code. These last two algorithms can't work with large datasets. The authors believe that the future belongs to the algorithms that will be able to handle large amount of source code. This algorithms can be used to train anti-plagiarism systems on large scale. They can be used also for optimization systems for source code.
