Plagiarism, or unauthorised reuse without linking text, is a phenomenon of great concern due to the wide variety of bibliographic and information resources available on the Internet. Due to the size of the problem, it is almost impossible to manually check for plagiarism. The so-called automatic plagiarism detector was created as a preventive and corrective measure to help people detect plagiarism in text, which is the job of forensic linguistics. It should be noted that automated plagiarism detection tools are only intended to help people detect plagiarism by providing them with the best possible evidence of a possible case of plagiarism. The final decision as well as the appropriate action should be taken by an expert.
Today, plagiarism, piracy and moral condemnation is a serious problem worldwide. It is necessary to understand the concept of plagiarism, the different types of plagiarism that exist and then to analyse its impact at the academic and professional level. Several cases of plagiarism at global and national level show the seriousness of the problem and its prevalence. Despite copyright laws, plagiarism is not exactly criminalised in all countries, which means that many of these acts often go unpunished. There is a need for better education on plagiarism to prevent future plagiarism.
