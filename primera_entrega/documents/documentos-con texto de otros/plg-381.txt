Plagiarism in research can occur accidentally or intentionally, resulting in copyright violations and harm to others. One common instance is when students submit research titles for assignments, and their proposals are rejected due to pre-existing titles, which can be seen as plagiarism. To address this issue and reduce plagiarism occurrences, a system is needed to detect similarities between submitted and existing titles. This study utilizes the winnowing algorithm to determine the percentage similarity between titles, using Google Scholar as a source of comparison titles. Web scraping techniques, including CURL and simple HTML DOM parser, are employed to retrieve title data from Google Scholar. The results show that the application of the Winnowing algorithm successfully identifies the percentage similarity with categories ranging from mild to severe plagiarism, enabling early detection and prevention of plagiarism. In the context of plagiarism detection, text alignment plays a crucial role in identifying similar text fragments between two documents. To enhance the performance of a plagiarism detection model, an optimization methodology based on genetic algorithms is introduced, aiming to optimize the model's input parameters. The genetic algorithm implementation includes nonbinary representation, elitism selection, uniform crossover, and a high mutation rate. By finding the optimal parameter settings, the plagiarism detection model achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.
