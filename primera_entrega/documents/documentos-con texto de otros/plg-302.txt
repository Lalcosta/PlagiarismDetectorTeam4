Plagiarism is the act of appropriating another's content or ideas without proper citation. This document is a survey that presents and compares some of the best research on the topic of plagiarism. Plagiarism is currently one of the most interesting and important research points in the field of natural language processing (NLP). We review several old research papers based on different types of plagiarism detection, their models, and algorithms; and compare the accuracy of these papers. There are many ways to detect plagiarism in different languages. There are algorithms for detecting plagiarism like Corpus, CL-CNG, LSI, Edit Distance, etc. After analyzing these files, we found that some algorithms have better performance and accuracy in detecting plagiarism. Weâ€™re going to look at some articles on plagiarism and discuss the pros and cons of this model. We also propose a sentence structure-based plagiarism detection method based on sentiment splitting, word splitting, synonyms, and comparison with arbitrary sources.
