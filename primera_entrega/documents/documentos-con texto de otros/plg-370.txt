Remote editing is a technique used in a variety of tasks, especially if those tasks aim at finding similarities between two objects, structures or, of course, text. Editing the distance between two objects is a method responsible for choosing from a set of precise operations with the minimum change necessary to convert one object into another. The set of operations allowed depends on the edit distance, although the most common are delete, insert, replace and replace parts of the object being edited. There are different edit distances to choose from depending on the task you are solving in text similarity detection.
Supervised learning is a method for inferring functions from training data. The training data consists of pairs of objects (usually represented by vectors); one component of this pair is the data describing each object, and the other is the class to which the object belongs. The output of the function can be either a numeric value or a label. The goal of supervised learning is to produce a function that is able to predict the value corresponding to any valid input object after looking at a set of examples, i.e. training data. To do this, it needs to generalise the data presented to situations that have never been seen before.
