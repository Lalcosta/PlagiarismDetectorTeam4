Plagiarism of digital documents seems a serious problem in today's era. Plagiarism refers to the use of someone's data, language and writing without proper acknowledgment of the original source. Plagiarism of another author's original work is one of the biggest problems in publishing, science, and education. Plagiarism can be of different types. This paper presents a different approach for measuring semantic similarity between words and their meanings. Existing systems are based on the traditional approach. This approach offers the opportunity to tie ethical issues to technical content at the moment students learn it, and to have students engage with these issues repeatedly throughout their degree. However, little is known about the effect of embedded ethics education on students. Therefore, two algorithms are presented: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which uses a neural network to process the natural language of the texts to capture the context of the words and understand the relationships between them as well as the algorithm USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) which converts sentences into vector representations to perform a semantic analysis.
