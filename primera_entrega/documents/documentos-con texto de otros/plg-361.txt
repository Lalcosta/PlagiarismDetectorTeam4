Text data is a type of unstructured information, which is easily processed by a human, but it is hard for the computer to understand. Text mining techniques effectively discover meaningful information from text, which has received a great deal of attention in recent years.into structured and normalized texts, yielding syntactic features for downstream task learning. In this work, we propose a systematic survey of low-level syntactic processing techniques, namely: microtext normalization, sentence boundary disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging, text chunking, and lemmatization.Then we propose a novel deep text clustering based on hybrid of a stacked autoencoder and k-means clustering to organize text documents into meaningful groups for mining information from Barez data in an unsupervised method.We summarize and categorize widely used methods in the aforementioned syntactic analysis tasks, investigate the challenges, and yield possible research directions to overcome the challenges in future
