Text plagiarism has greatly spread in the recent years, it becomes a common problem in several fields such as research manuscripts, textbooks, patents, academic circles, etc. There are many sentence similarity features were used to detect plagiarism, but each of them is not discriminative to differentiate the similarity cases. This causes the discovery of lexical, syntactic and semantic text plagiarism types to be a challenging problem. Therefore, a new plagiarism detection system is proposed. The whole system consists of several parts. A classification of source code is an essential part of the whole system because it makes it much more efficient to manipulate source code and divide data into individual clusters so that searching in large volumes of source code is as efficient as possible. The paper discusses how to optimize the implementation of clustering, so the whole system would deliver results in a reasonable time because allocating the different parts of the source code into suitable clusters will allow faster and more memory-efficient search for similar parts of the code.
