Natural language processing is a discipline rooted in both linguistics and computer science. It incorporates syntactic problems (grammatical category, word segmentation, name entity recognition, etc.), semantics (sentiments analysis, texts categorization, translation, questions answering, etc.), vocal signals generation from texts or texts generation from vocal signals, etc. In the last few years, some scientists and companies have been able to create algorithms capable of achieving very high levels of performance for some of these tasks.
TFIDF algorithm is used to extract the preprocessed text keywords and obtain the keyword weight. Based on the weight, cosine distance method is used to calculate the text similarity of text keywords of different texts.
