Test Collusion (TC) is a form of cheating in which test takers operate in groups to alter normal item responses. CT is becoming increasingly common, especially within large-scale, high-risk exams. However, research on CT detection methods remains sparse. This article proposes a new algorithm for the detection of CT, inspired by the selection of variables within the high-dimensional statistical analysis.
This article presents a lemmatization system for the Urdu language, based on a novel dictionary lookup approach. The contributions made through this research are as follows: (1) the development of a large reference corpus for the Urdu language, (2) the exploration of the relationship between part-of-speech labels and the stemmer, and (3) ) the development of standard approaches for an Urdu stemmer. Additionally, we experiment with the impact of Part of Speech (PoS) in our proposed dictionary lookup approach. Empirical results showed that we achieved the best accuracy score of 76.44% through the proposed dictionary lookup approach.
