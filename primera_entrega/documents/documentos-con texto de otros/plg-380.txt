Plagiarism is a common problem in the modern age, where the convenience of accessing other people's writings and publications through the Internet has increased the likelihood of undesirable use of content. This infringement of intellectual property rights poses a serious challenge in today's society. Traditional methods such as the vector space model or bag-of-words have proven inadequate in effectively detecting plagiarism due to their limited ability to handle word semantics satisfactorily. In response to this issue, we have developed a prototype called Gemini. Through extensive evaluation, we have found that Gemini surpasses existing approaches in terms of similarity detection accuracy by a significant margin. Additionally, Gemini drastically improves the efficiency of prior art's embedding generation, reducing the time required from over a week to just 30 minutes to 10 hours. On the other hand, we have made an intriguing observation regarding the relationship between singular vectors and concept vectors. While singular vectors are dense and global in the word space, we have discovered that the linear subspaces spanned by concept vectors and leading singular vectors exhibit remarkably small principal angles between them. This finding highlights the power and localized nature of the concept vectors generated by the spherical k-means algorithm, serving as a robust and sparse "basis" for text data sets.
