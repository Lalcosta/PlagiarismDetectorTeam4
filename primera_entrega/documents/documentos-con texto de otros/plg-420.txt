Background: It is well-known that abdominal radiotherapy for testicular cancer (TC) poses a significant risk for developing second stomach cancer. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding the relationship between radiation dose and the likelihood of this occurrence.

Methods: We conducted a study involving a cohort of 22,269 TC survivors who were diagnosed between 1959 and 1987. Among this group, we estimated the radiation doses to various subsites of the stomach for 92 patients who later developed stomach cancer, as well as 180 matched controls. Detailed information regarding chemotherapy treatments was also collected. To assess the association between radiation exposure and stomach cancer risk, we employed logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs).

Results: The cumulative incidence of second primary stomach cancer was found to be 1.45% at 30 years following the initial TC diagnosis. Among the TC survivors who had received radiotherapy (87 cases, accounting for 95% of the cases, and 151 controls, accounting for 84% of the controls), the risk of developing stomach cancer was elevated by a factor of 5.9 (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.7-20.7). Furthermore, there was a dose-response relationship, with the risk increasing as the stomach dose increased (P-trend < 0.001). Specifically, the odds ratio was 20.5 (with a range of 3.7-114.3) for individuals who received a dose of 50.0 Gy or higher, compared to those who received less than 10 Gy. Notably, the elevated risk associated with radiation exposure persisted for at least 20 years after the initial exposure (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the risk of stomach cancer was not significantly increased by any chemotherapy treatment (OR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.5-2.5; 14 cases and 23 controls).

Conclusions: In conclusion, radiotherapy for TC that involves irradiating parts of the stomach leads to an increased risk of gastric cancer for several decades. The highest risks are observed among individuals who receive stomach doses of 30 Gy or higher. It is crucial for clinicians to be aware of these excess risks when TC survivors, who were previously exposed to radiation, present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, the potential risks associated with radiotherapy should be carefully considered in newly diagnosed TC patients.
