The objective of this document is to evaluate the problems that arise from plagiarism, especially in those worked with texts reused in academic work by students in their academic entities. We focus on preprocessing techniques for Slovak text mappings, such as stopword removal, synonym substitution, lemmatization, and use of the readability index. However, the main objective of this article is to identify, analyze and differentiate an original student activity and compare it with a document suspected of plagiarism and denote its readability, understanding of the subject and similarities between both documents. Finally, already having the results of the experiments and document tests, it was found that the technical combinations and preprocessing methods, to denote the similarities of the students' activities are more effective and if it is desired to analyze and present a similarity with a possible accuracy, the types of plagiarism can be reached and detected with the methods that will be seen in this document later.
