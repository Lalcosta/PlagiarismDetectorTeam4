This chapter deals with plagiarism detection. After explaining the difference between plagiarism and copyright infringement, the chapter analyses the problems that challenge the expert linguist's work, especially the undervaluation of scientific linguistic expertise in the courts of justice, the admissibility of scientific evidence in the courts of justice and the evaluation of text similarity.
In this paper, we propose BinShot, a BERT-based similarity learning architecture that is highly transferable for effective BCSD. We tackle the problem of detecting code similarity with one-shot learning (a special case of few-shot learning). To this end, we adopt a weighted distance vector with a binary cross entropy as a loss function on top of BERT. Furthermore, the chapter points to the essential complementary role that qualitative linguistic analysis plays in plagiarism detection and draws attention to the relevance of context in understanding and interpreting the data appropriately. Lastly, the chapter provides the reader with a detailed step-by-step analysis of a live case of plagiarism between translators.
