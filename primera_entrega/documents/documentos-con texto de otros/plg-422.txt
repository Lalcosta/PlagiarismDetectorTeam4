Background: The presence of multiple cancers may indicate a shared underlying cause. While several studies have explored the risk of second primary cancers following prostate cancer (PCa), none have investigated the occurrence of cancers prior to PCa.

Methods: This study utilized the PCBaSe Sweden database, which draws data from the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR), covering over 96% of PCa cases. The authors examined the prevalence and cumulative incidence of various cancers before and after PCa diagnosis in a cohort of 72,613 men, considering PCa treatment and disease stage. A matched comparison cohort of PCa-free men was also included.

Results: Among the total cohort, 6,829 men were diagnosed with another primary cancer before their PCa diagnosis. This included 138 men who received simultaneous diagnoses of PCa and another cancer, and 5,230 men who were diagnosed with a subsequent cancer after PCa. The most commonly observed cancers both before and after PCa diagnosis were bladder or colon cancer, and nonmelanoma skin cancer. At the time of PCa diagnosis, the prevalence of these three cancers was 1.94% for bladder cancer, 1.08% for colon cancer, and 1.08% for nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared to 1.30%, 0.96%, and 1.03% respectively, in the matched comparison cohort. Five years after PCa diagnosis, the difference in incidence proportion between PCa men and the comparison cohort was 7% (95% CI: 5.6%-8.5%), 1.3% (0%-2.6%), and 1.6% (0.6%-2.6%) for bladder, colon, and nonmelanoma skin cancers, respectively. Notably, the prevalence of kidney cancer at the time of PCa diagnosis was 0.42%, compared to 0.28% in the matched comparison cohort, which is of interest from a uro-oncologic perspective.

Conclusions: Roughly 17% of all PCa cases occurred alongside another primary cancer, either before or after the PCa diagnosis. Part of this observation may be attributed to detection bias, but further investigations are necessary to explore potential underlying mechanisms.
