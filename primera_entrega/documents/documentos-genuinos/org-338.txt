Gender identification of short text author using conceptual vectorization
The rapid growth of technology and cyberspace has changed the scope and nature of human identity from physical to virtual. New forms of abuse, such as Internet fraud, impersonation, identity theft, and plagiarism have also emerged. Content theft and spoofing have been prevalent in various texts such as news, social network messages and email. The identity of active people in cyberspace, especially criminals, should be identified. One of the most important parts of identifying a person is their gender identity, identifying the text author gender will help to solve this problem. This Article presents a method for improving the gender identification of Persian short text author using conceptual vectorization. Due to the lack of proper data available for this research in Persian language with a valid author's name tag and their text written by the individual himself, a data set was created using valid information. The approach of this project is to use conceptual vectorization method to perform mathematical operations on vector words. Conceptual vectorization attempts to vectorize words in such a way that mathematical calculations make sense on the resulting vectors. To train a system that can identify the gender of the author of text, a neural network capable of learning complex functions was developed and implemented using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. The proposed method, which is based on conceptual vectorization and using neural network for training, achieved a 22% improvement in identifying the gender of the author compared to related tasks. Based on the five-fold cross validation method, accuracy of 81.09% was obtained.
