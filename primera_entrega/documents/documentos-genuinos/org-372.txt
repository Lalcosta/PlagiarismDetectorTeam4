There are different classifications of which parts of a text (or spoken language) can be plagiarised.
* On the idea: This type of plagiarism is not based on words. A accepts the ideas, thoughts or theories of others without giving them equal weight. This type of plagiarism occurs when the original idea is not made public.
 * Word for word This is a copy of (an important part of) a sentence. And you can make an exact copy and even make some modifications. If there is no link to the source, it is plagiarism. In addition to literal plagiarism, there is interpretive plagiarism in which both wording and syntax are altered. This approach of interpreting as a form of plagiarism is not entirely correct.
* From sources: By including bibliographical references that another author has included in his own work d. However, A does not claim that these references are taken from d. Sometimes, A includes links without even reading them. 
*Authoritative means that the author of all the material is actually written by someone else. It is not uncommon for students to present other people's reports as their own.
