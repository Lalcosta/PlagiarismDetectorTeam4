Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) plays a big role in the process of binary application security test. It can be applied in several fields, such as software plagiarism detection, malware analysis, vulnerability detection. Most research is based on recurrent neural networks, which is difficult to get the overall or long-distance semantic information of functions. Besides, exiting works simply extract high-level semantic features, lacking in-depth investigations on the potential mechanisms for fusing low-level and high-level semantic features. In this paper we propose a multi-semantic feature fusion attention network (MFFA-Net) for BCSD. MFFA-Net contains two critical modules: semantic feature fusion (SFF) and attention feature fusion (AFF). The SFF module concatenates multiple semantic features to represent the semantics of the function, which helps to obtain the overall semantic information of the function. The AFF module is designed to find useful information from various features, which assigns an attention matrix to research the relationship between features. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we made extensive experiments on two datasets. MFFA-Net can achieve a high degree of AUC at 99.6% and 98.3% respectively on the two datasets. The experimental results show that MFFA-Net has better performance for BCSD.
