BERT and USE
This article presents an analysis of techniques for detecting plagiarism through the semantic relationships between words. The purpose of this research is to identify paraphrasing in academic texts through the rearrangement of words using synonyms. Therefore, two algorithms are presented: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which uses a neural network to process the natural language of the texts to capture the context of the words and understand the relationships between them as well as the algorithm USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) which converts sentences into vector representations to perform a semantic analysis.
