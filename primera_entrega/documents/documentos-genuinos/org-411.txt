Search engines are vulnerable to attacks against indexing and
searching via text encoding manipulation. By imperceptibly perturbing text using uncommon encoded representations, adversaries
can control results across search engines for specific search queries.
We demonstrate that this attack is successful against two major
commercial search engines - Google and Bing - and one open source
search engine - Elasticsearch. We further demonstrate that this attack is successful against LLM chat search including Bing’s GPT-4
chatbot and Google’s Bard chatbot. We also present a variant of the
attack targeting text summarization and plagiarism detection models, two ML tasks closely tied to search. We provide a set of defenses
against these techniques and warn that adversaries can leverage
these attacks to launch disinformation campaigns against unsuspecting users, motivating the need for search engine maintainers
to patch deployed systems.
