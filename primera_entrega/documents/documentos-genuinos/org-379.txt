Remote editing is a technique used in a variety of tasks, especially if those tasks aim at finding similarities between two objects, structures or, of course, text. Editing the distance between two objects is a method responsible for choosing from a set of precise operations with the minimum change necessary to convert one object into another. The set of operations allowed depends on the edit distance, although the most common are delete, insert, replace and replace parts of the object being edited. There are different edit distances to choose from depending on the task you are solving in text similarity detection.
