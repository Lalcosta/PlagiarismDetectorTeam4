The text similarity task is concerned with comparing documents to find similarities between them. Text similarity methods have had very important applications in natural language and information retrieval for many years. A variation of these methods are those that compute similarity on short texts; the task is slightly more difficult than the original task due to the small amount of information that is processed to achieve text similarity. Some examples of applications that calculate similarity in short texts are Automatic Translation Score, Interpretation Detection, Plagiarism Detection, Automatic Summary Score, Automatic Response, etc.
