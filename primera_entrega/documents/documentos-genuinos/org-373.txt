Detecting plagiarism from modified copy created by substitution paraphrasing, synonyms, generalisations and rearrangements is a little more difficult to detect. Without judging whether or not it is a real case of plagiarism, it is an expert's job to find such closely related snippets that can be of great help in helping you decide. Therefore, it is necessary to refer to interpretation detection models, which so far have been somewhat remote in the development of plagiarism detection methods, possibly because of their complexity.
