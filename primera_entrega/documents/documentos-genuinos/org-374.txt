In recent years, large collections of digital documents have been created for easy reference. These collections contain works covering a wide range of topics with a variety of approaches. As the amount of information grows significantly, automated tools are needed to help us manage this information. Tools for processing large amounts of information are available. Such tools can be: text classification by topic, plagiarism detection systems, social media reputation determination and others. These systems have very important things in common; they need to know the degree of text similarity between a pair of texts. Calculating text similarity is necessary for many tasks. For this reason, textual similarity has recently attracted a lot of interest in the scientific community. A particular problem of text similarity detection is to detect similarity in short texts, which is somewhat more difficult than in the original text due to the amount of information available for decision making.
