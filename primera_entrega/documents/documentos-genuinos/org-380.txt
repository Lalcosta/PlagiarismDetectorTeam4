Plagiarism is a common problem in the modern age. With the advance of Internet, it is more and more convenient to access other peopleâ€™s writings or publications. When someone uses the content of a text in an undesirable way, plagiarism may occur. Plagiarism infringes the intellectual property rights, so it is a serious problem nowadays. However, detecting plagiarism effectively is a challenging work. Traditional methods, like vector space model or bag-of-words, are short of providing a good solution due to the incapability of handling the semantics of words satisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a new method for plagiarism detection. We use Word2vec to transform the words into word vectors which are able to reveal the semantic relationship among different words. Through word vectors, words are clustered into concepts. Then documents and their paragraphs are represented in terms of concepts, and plagiarism detection can be done more effectively. A number of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of our proposed method.
